- **Rule Name:** Provide a unique name for your cache rule to easily identify it.
- **Rule Type:** Select how the rule applies:
    1. **Prefix**: Applies to URLs that begin with a specific string.
    2. **Regex**: Applies to a pattern matching multiple URLs based on a regular expression.
- **Match Pattern**: Define the URL pattern for the cache rule. The pattern must start with **`/`** and cannot contain spaces or **`*`**.

- **Ignore Origin Server No Cache**: Enable this setting to cache content even if the origin server sends no-cache headers. 
- **Ignore Client No Cache**: Enable this option to ignore no-cache headers from client requests, allowing content to be cached regardless of client-side instructions.
- **Never Cache**: Prevents caching entirely, regardless of the origin headers. This setting ensures that content is never cached by the CDN.
- **Ignore Query String in Cache Key**: Enable this setting to ignore query strings when storing cached content. 
- **Gzip Compression**: Enable Gzip Compression to compress files for faster delivery. This is beneficial for text-based content, such as **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** files.
