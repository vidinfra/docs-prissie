# Video FAQs

Find answers to the most common questions about using **Vidinfra** for video upload, processing, and delivery.

---

### 1. What video formats does Vidinfra support?

Vidinfra supports most major formats including **`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.flv`, and `.webm`.**
For best compatibility and upload speed, we recommend using **`MP4`** (**`H.264`**).

---

### 2. Is there a file size limit for uploads?

There’s no fixed file size limit. Vidinfra supports large uploads of **100GB** and beyond using multipart and resumable uploads through the API.

For best performance, use the official **SDK** or import through cloud storage such as **S3** or **GCS**.

### 3. Can I import videos from external sources like YouTube, Vimeo or cloud storage?

Yes. You can **import videos from any public or signed URL**, including:
- **Vimeo, Bunny, Zoom, Vdocipher, Gumlet, Wistia** or **YouTube video links**.
- Amazon S3 / Google Cloud Storage / Azure Blob URLs.
- Any HTTPS-accessible file.

Vidinfra fetches and processes the file automatically once you submit the `input` URL.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.vidinfra.io/v1/assets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIDINFRA_API_KEY" \
  -d '{ "input": "https://example.com/video.mp4" }'
```

### 4. How does Vidinfra handle large uploads?

Vidinfra uses a multipart upload engine that splits large files into smaller chunks.

This ensures reliable transfers even over unstable connections and allows automatic resume if the upload is interrupted. 

### 4. Can I upload videos directly from my local device?

Yes. You can upload videos directly from your computer or mobile device using the Upload Video option in the Vidinfra Dashboard.

Simply drag and drop your file, or select it manually from your file manager.

---

### 5. What happens after upload?

Once uploaded, Vidinfra automatically:

1. Validates the file format and metadata.
2. Transcodes the video into multiple adaptive renditions (`HLS` + `DASH`).
3. Generates thumbnails and animated previews.
4. Makes the video ready for playback or embedding in under a few seconds.

---

### 6. Can I monitor upload progress?

Yes. The upload progress is displayed in real time within the Encoding Queue on your dashboard.

You can track the percentage completed, estimated time, and current processing status.

---

### 7. Where are my uploaded videos stored?

All videos are stored securely in **Tenbyte’s S3-compatible cloud storage**.

This ensures low latency, compliance with local data laws, and high availability.

---

### 8. Does Vidinfra support resumable uploads?

Yes. Vidinfra supports resumable uploads through its **API** and **SDKs**.

If your connection drops mid-upload, the system automatically resumes from the last completed chunk.

---

### 9. Can I upload live streams?

Yes. Vidinfra also supports live video ingestion using **RTMP**.

You can connect popular tools like **OBS**, **Wirecast**, or **Streamyard** to stream live content directly to Vidinfra.

---

### 10. Can I organize my videos by folders or projects?

Yes. You can create multiple libraries or folders to manage projects, campaigns, or different business units separately within your Vidinfra workspace.

### 11. How long does video processing take?

Vidinfra’s **AI-powered compression engine** optimizes processing to make videos stream-ready within seconds, even for large files.

---

### 12. Can developers manage videos via API?

Yes. Vidinfra is **fully API-driven**. Everything available in the dashboard can also be managed through A**PI calls**. You can upload, encode, publish, and track videos programmatically.
