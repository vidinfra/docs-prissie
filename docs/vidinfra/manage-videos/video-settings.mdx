# Control Video Settings

The Video Settings panel lets you manage every detail of a video after uploading. You can update **basic information**, **add subtitles**, **create chapters**, and **view technical metadata**. Each section is designed to help you organize, improve, and monitor your video asset.

Vidinfra divides video settings into four tabs:

1. Overview
2. Subtitles
3. Chapters
4. Others

Below is a full explanation of each tab.

## 1. Overview

The **Overview tab** contains the core information about your video. You can update the **name**, add a **description**, **manage tags**, and **set thumbnails**.

    </Frame>

### Name
Enter a title that identifies your video. This name appears across your Vidinfra dashboard and in all video listings.

### Description
Add a short description to explain what the video covers. This is helpful when managing large libraries or sharing content with teams.

### Tags
Tags help you organize and filter videos. Add multiple tags to group videos by category, event, project, or workflow. For advanced tag management, check [Library Settings](/docs/vidinfra/manage-library/library-settings#organize-videos-with-tags).

### Thumbnails
Choose a thumbnail to represent the video.
You can:
1. Select a generated thumbnail
2. Upload a custom image
3. Drag and drop an image into the upload area

## 2. Subtitles

The **Subtitles tab** allows you to upload caption files for your video. Subtitles help improve accessibility, viewer engagement, and searchability.

     </Frame>

### Language Selection
Choose the subtitle language from the dropdown list.

### Upload Subtitle File
Upload a subtitle file by:

1. Dragging and dropping it into the file box
2. Clicking browse file to select it from your device
3. Vidinfra supports standard subtitle formats like VTT and SRT.

### Multiple Subtitles
Click Add More to upload multiple subtitle tracks.

## 3. Chapters

The **Chapters tab** lets you break your video into sections. Chapters help viewers jump to key moments and improve navigation in long videos.

        <img src="/images/vidinfra/library-21.png" alt="Add Chapters" />
    </Frame>
### Add Chapters

- Click **Add More** to create a new chapter.
- Enter the timestamp and title for each chapter.
- Add as many chapters as you need.

If your video has no chapters yet, the panel will show: **“No chapters added yet.”**

## 4. Others

The **Others tab** displays technical metadata and asset information about your video. This section helps you understand the processing status, quality outputs, and file properties.

### Meta Data
Add custom key–value pairs to store extra information about the video. Examples:
- Category
- Campaign name
- Internal tracking IDs
- Creator information

You can add multiple metadata fields using **Add More**.

### Asset Info
This section shows core details of your video asset, including:

1. **Status** – Shows whether the video is playable
2. **Duration** – Video length
3. **Format** – Playback format (e.g., `ABR`)
4. **Resolutions** – Available output qualities (240p to 1080p)
5. **Original File Size** – Size of the uploaded file
6. **Total File Size** – Size of all processed output variants

### Timeline

Displays the full processing history of the video. You can track each stage with timestamps:

- Playable
- Saving
- Packaging
- Transcoding

This helps you verify when each processing step finished and ensures the video is ready for playback.
