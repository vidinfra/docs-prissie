### Embed your Video
Embedding a video lets you display it directly on your website or app without storing the file yourself. It’s the easiest way to stream securely using Vidinfra’s cloud delivery.

- A pop-up window will appear when you click the chain icon on your selected video. From this window, click on **Copy Embed Code** and paste it into your website to display the video.

- In the Embed section, you can choose between **Responsive** and **Fixed player** sizes to match your layout, and enable or disable **Player Controls**, **Autoplay**, **Loop**, or **Mute** to customize the viewing experience.

### URLs
The URLs tab provides direct links for viewing, streaming, and integrating your videos across platforms.
Each link type serves a specific purpose depending on how you plan to use your video.

- When you click the URLs tab next to Embed, you’ll see multiple links for playback, integration, and sharing.
