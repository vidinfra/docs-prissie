# Manage Your Active Sessions

The Session Management page helps you keep track of where your account is logged in. It shows the devices and browsers that still have access, so you can sign out anything you’re not using anymore. It’s useful when you move between different computers or forget to log out somewhere, and it gives you an easy way to make sure only the places you trust can reach your account.

## 1. Current Sessions
- This section shows the device you are currently using to access your Tenbyte account.

    </Frame>

For each active session, you will see:
    
    1. Device Type (e.g., Desktop)
    2. IP Address
    3. Activation Time (when the session started)

This helps you confirm that the current login session is valid and expected.

## 2. Other Sessions

The **Other Sessions** section lists all additional devices that are signed in to your account.

    </Frame>

Each entry displays:

    1. Device name
    2. IP address
    2. Last active timestamp
    3. Terminate button

If you see a session you don’t recognize, you can **click Terminate** to immediately revoke access for that device.

### Ending a Session

To **remove a session** find the session under **Other Sessions** and click **Terminate**. The device will be logged out instantly.
