# Player Theme Settings

Configure the player’s appearance and interface elements to align with your design preferences.

## 1. Open the Player Settings

From the left sidebar of your library, click on **Settings** and then select **Player** to open the player customization page.

        <img src="/images/vidinfra/library-23.png" alt="Player Settings" />
    </Frame>

This section lets you control how your video player looks and behaves across devices.

On the dashboard, you’ll see two sample configurations:

1. **Mobile Player** – optimized for smaller screens
2. **Default Player** – designed for standard web playback

    </Frame>

You can edit these players or create a new one from the top right corner based on your needs.

<Note>Both the mobile player and default player use the same settings and customization options.</Note>

## 2. General Info

The **General Info section** lets you define the basic details and visual style of your video player.

    </Frame>

These settings help you identify the player and control the colors used across its interface.    

### Player Name
Enter a name to identify this player preset. This helps you manage multiple players—for example, different themes for mobile, web, or specific projects.

### Primary Color
Choose the main color used in the player interface. This color is applied to key elements such as:

- The large play button
- Progress bar and seekbar
- Action highlights


## 3. Player Features

The **Player Features section** lets you control how the Vidinfra player behaves during playback. Each toggle enables or disables a specific capability that affects the viewer experience.

### Preload Video on Page Load
Loads video metadata as soon as the page opens. This reduces start time and improves playback speed.

### Subtitles
Allows viewers to turn on subtitle tracks if you uploaded any in the video settings.

### Chapters
Shows chapter markers inside the player so viewers can jump to key parts of the video.

### Picture in Picture
Lets viewers pop the video into a small floating window while browsing other tabs or apps.

### Allow Cast
Enables casting to supported devices like smart TVs. Not available for DRM or watermarked videos.

### Video Loop
Restarts the video automatically after it finishes.

### Resumable Player Position
Saves the viewer’s last watch position, allowing them to continue from where they left off.

### Big Play Button
Displays a large play button at the center of the video before playback.

### Hide Player Controls
Removes all control buttons for a clean, minimal viewing experience.

### Custom Overlays
Use the Brand Appearance section to add your own logo as a custom overlay or watermark on the video player. 

    <Frame caption="Customize your Watermark">
        <img src="/images/vidinfra/library-28.png" alt="Customize your Watermark" />
    </Frame>

#### Upload Brand Logo
You can drag and drop the image or browse files manually. The logo appears as a watermark on the player.

#### Logo Destination URL
Add a link that viewers will be taken to when they click your logo. Use this to direct users to your website, landing page, or campaign URL.

<Warning>The watermark image must be smaller than 2MB. Larger files will not upload.</Warning>

## 4. Advanced Settings

The **Advanced Settings section** is designed for developers and teams who want deeper branding or analytics integration.
