# Tenbyte Cloud Block Storage

Block Storage in Tenbyte Cloud lets you attach high performance disks to your virtual machines. You can create new disks, expand existing ones, and manage storage based on your application’s needs.

This guide walks you through each step, from selecting your VM to resizing and managing disks.
