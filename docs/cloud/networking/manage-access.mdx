Access Delegation in Tenbyte Cloud allows controlled sharing of cloud resources with other users or systems. 

You can grant limited access to a specific billing account or provide full access across all associated resources, while maintaining clear permission boundaries.

## Access Delegation 
Allows you to delegate access to a user or system, enabling them to manage resources under your account.

- Under **Scope**, select **Restricted**.
- Choose the **Billing Account** you wish to share access to.
- Enter the **email address** of the user you want to delegate access to.
- Provide an **Access Name**.
- Click **Create** to send the access invitation to the specified email.

- Follow the same steps as above to create a new access delegation.
- Under **Scope**, select **Global**.
- Choose the **Billing Account** you wish to share access to.
- Enter the **email address** of the user for access delegation.
- Provide an **Access Name**.

## Created Access Delegations

- Once the **Access Delegation** is created, you will see the **delegated access listed** under the Access section.
- The status of the delegated access will be shown as **Pending** until the user accepts the access invitation.
- Once accepted, the user will be able to perform actions as per the scope of access.
