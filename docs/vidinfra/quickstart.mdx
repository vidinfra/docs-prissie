# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you upload, process, and play your first video with **Vidinfra** — a fully managed cloud video infrastructure for ingest, transcoding, and delivery.

In just a few steps, you’ll go from a raw video file to a globally delivered, adaptive streaming playback URL.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A **Tenbyte account** — [Sign up](https://beta.tenbyte.io/vidinfra)
- An **API key** with `assets:write` permission
- A **video file** ready to upload (e.g. `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mkv`)
