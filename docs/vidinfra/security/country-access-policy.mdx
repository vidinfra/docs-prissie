## Country Access Policy
The **Country Access Policy** lets you control where your videos can be viewed by allowing or blocking specific countries. 

### Allow by Default

When selected, your videos are accessible to all countries except the ones you choose to block. Use this option if you want your content to be generally available with a few restricted regions.

    <Frame caption="Allow by Default">
        <img src="/images/vidinfra/library-39.png" alt="Allow by Default" />
    </Frame>

### Deny by Default

When selected, your videos are blocked for all countries except the ones you choose to allow. This option is useful when your content is regional or limited to a specific audience.

    <Frame caption="Deny by Default">
        <img src="/images/vidinfra/library-40.png" alt="Deny by Default" />
    </Frame>

### Select Countries

Add the countries you want to allow or block, depending on your chosen rule. 

**Vidinfra** will automatically enforce access restrictions during playback based on the viewer’s location.

<Danger>Adding the wrong countries may restrict viewer access. Double-check your selections.</Danger>
