# Configure a New Webhook
Create a webhook that sends event notifications to your server as videos move through their processing stages.

## Create a Webhook
To create a new webhook, click **New Webhook** in the top right corner of the dashboard.

    </Frame>

Follow these steps to create a new webhook for receiving video event notifications:

### 1. Add a Name
Enter a name for your webhook under Video Event Notifications. This helps you identify the webhook when you manage multiple integrations.

### 2. Provide the Endpoint URL
Paste the URL where Vidinfra should send webhook events into the Endpoints field. This must be a valid, publicly accessible endpoint from your server or application.

<Tip>Make sure your webhook endpoint is publicly accessible and returns a 200 response.</Tip>

### 3. Select Events to Monitor
Choose the video lifecycle events you want to receive notifications for. Available events include:

- **`created`**
- **`uploading`**
- **`queued`**
- **`processing`**
- **`partial_playable`**
- **`playable`**
- **`transcoding`**
- **`packaging`**
- **`saving`**
- **`transcoding_failed`**
- **`pulling`**
- **`pulling_failed`**
- **`failed`**

Select the events relevant to your workflow.

<Warning>Selecting too many event types may generate a high number of webhook calls. Choose only the events your workflow needs.</Warning>

### 4. Add a Secret Token (Optional)
You can add a Secret Token to secure webhook deliveries. This token allows your server to verify that the request came from Vidinfra.

### 5. Create the Webhook
Click Create to save your webhook. Your endpoint will now start receiving notifications for the selected events.

    <Frame caption="Create your Webhook">

    </Frame>

Your **webhook** is now created and ready to receive events.
