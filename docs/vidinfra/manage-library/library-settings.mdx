Manage how your video library is structured and controlled using a centralized configuration panel.

## Create your Library
- Start by creating a library that fits your workflow. Add a name, choose a category, and set it as your workspace base. For detailed steps, visit [Set Up Your Vidinfra Workspace](/docs/vidinfra/quickstart).

## Open Your Vidinfra Library
- When you select Vidinfra from the left sidebar, you will see all the libraries you created.

### Search by File Name

### Filter by Tags

Filter your videos using the tags you assigned during upload or editing. This is useful for grouping videos by category, project, or workflow.

### Filter by Status

You can filter videos based on their current state, including **Processing**, **Transcoding**, or other workflow stages. This helps you review progress at a glance and track pending tasks.

## Organize Videos with Tags
Tags help you group videos by topic, project stage, event type, or team ownership. You can attach several tags to the same video to keep large collections easier to navigate.

### How to Add Tags
1. Pick the videos you want to update from your library.
2. Scroll to the Tags section in the details panel.
3. Type the tags you want to assign and save your changes.
