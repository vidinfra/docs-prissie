## 2. Access Delegation 
Allows you to delegate access to a user or system, enabling them to manage resources under your account. 

### For Restricted Scope
Restricted Scope means the user will have access only to the resources tied to the selected billing account.

- Click on **New** to create a **new access delegation**.
- Under **Scope**, select **Restricted**.
- Choose the **Billing Account** you wish to share access to.
- Enter the **email address** of the user you want to delegate access to.
- Provide an **Access Name**.
- Click **Create** to send the access invitation to the specified email.

### For Global Scope
**Global Scope** means the user will have access to all resources under the billing account.

- Follow the same steps as above to create a new access delegation.
- Under **Scope**, select **Global**.
- Choose the **Billing Account** you wish to share access to.
- Enter the **email address** of the user for access delegation.
- Provide an **Access Name**.
- Click **Create** to send the access invitation.

<Warning>
    Be cautious when selecting Global, as it grants access to all resources within the billing account.
</Warning>


<Note>
    The user will receive an invitation to accept access to the specified billing account.
</Note>

### 3. Access for API Token
API Token is used to generate a key for interacting with Tenbyte Cloud’s API.
- Navigate to the **Access** section again and click on **New**.
- Select **API Token** under Type.
- Provide an **Access Name** for your API token.
- Click **Create** to generate the API token.

    </Frame>

<Note>
    For API Token, the scope type works similarly to Access Delegations, allowing you to specify restricted or global access.
</Note>

### 4. Created Access Delegations

- Once the **Access Delegation** is created, you will see the **delegated access listed** under the Access section.
- The status of the delegated access will be shown as **Pending** until the user accepts the access invitation.
- Once accepted, the user will be able to perform actions as per the scope of access.
