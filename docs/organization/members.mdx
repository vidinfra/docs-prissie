    </Frame>
From this dashboard you can view -

   1. **Name** — The member’s full name
   2. **Email** — Email address used to sign in
   3. **Connected With** — Sign-in provider like email, Google, or GitHub
   4. **Role** — Owner, Admin, Member, or custom-defined role
   5. **Joined At** — The date and time the member joined your workspace

To manage a member, open the three-dot menu beside their name.

    <Frame caption="Actions">
        <img src="/images/account/13.png" alt="Actions" />
    </Frame>

The menu gives you a few options:

    1. **Manage Permission** — Adjust what this person can access and control 
    2. **Remove Member** — Remove the user from your organization  
<Danger>
    Removing a member immediately revokes access to all dashboards, APIs, and distributions.

    </Frame>

Here’s how the invitation works:

    1. **Enter Email Address** - In the Invite Member section, type the email of the person you want to invite.
    2. **Send Invitation** - Once the email is entered click on **Send invitation**, an invitation will be sent.

    </Frame>

<Warning>
    The person you invite must accept the email invitation before they appear in your Members list.
</Warning>

Once they join, you can assign permissions to decide what they can access.

## Permissions
- Permissions define what a member can view, edit, or delete inside your organization. Permissions are grouped into two areas:

    1. CDN Distribution
    2. Organization

You can switch between these tabs to assign access rights.

### CDN Distribution Permissions
- If your organization has CDN distributions, they will appear in this area. 

Each distribution can have its own access settings.

    </Frame>

If you want to create a new distribution, check the guide at [Create CDN Distribution](docs/cdn/distributions/create-distribution).

### Organization Permissions

- These permissions control access to global settings within your workspace. 

    <Frame caption="Organization Permissions">
        <img src="/images/account/17.png" alt="Organization Permissions" />
    </Frame>

You can assign access for:

1. **Members** — Invite users and manage their permissions  
2. **Billing** — View invoices and payment information  
3. **API** — Create and manage API keys  

    For each area, you can choose:

        - **`can view`**
        - **`can edit`**
        - **`can edit`** (no delete)
        - **`no access`**

This lets you set up access in a way that fits your team and how you want to share responsibilities.
