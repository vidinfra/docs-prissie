# Response Classes (Non 2xx)

The Response Classes (Non 2xx) section tracks the number of HTTP responses that fall outside the successful 2xx range, including errors like 4xx (client-side) and 5xx (server-side) errors.

## What it tells you:

- The number of failed requests or errors served by your CDN.
- How client-side (4xx) and server-side (5xx) errors are distributed.
- Whether the frequency of these errors has increased or decreased compared to the previous period.

## How to read it:
- The main number indicates the count of non-2xx responses, broken down into 4xx and 5xx errors.
- The percentage compares today’s errors with those from the previous day, helping you track trends in failed requests.
