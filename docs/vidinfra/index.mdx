# What is Vidinfra?

**Vidinfra** is **Tenbyte’s end-to-end video infrastructure platform** designed for developers and media teams who need full control over video hosting, encoding, delivery, and playback. 

Most teams struggle when trying to handle video on their own, uploading raw files, creating multiple resolutions, managing storage, optimizing playback for slow networks, securing content, setting up CDNs, and maintaining delivery performance. These tasks often require heavy compute resources, specialized tools, and constant infrastructure upkeep.

Vidinfra simplifies the entire process by combining **video ingest, encoding, storage, delivery, playback, analytics,** and **security** into one platform.
