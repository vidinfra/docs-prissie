# Purge your Content by Pattern

The **Purge by Pattern** option allows you to remove cached content based on specific **URL patterns**. 

This is useful when you want to clear specific files or resources, such as **images** or **static files**, without affecting the entire cache.

## 1. Enter Purge Patterns
- In the input box, enter the URL patterns for the content you want to purge. 

    <Frame caption="Purge by Pattern">
        <img src="/images/cdn/34.png" alt="Origin" />
    </Frame>

- Each pattern must start with **`/`**, and you can use **`*`** as a wildcard to specify multiple files. For example:
    - **`/images/*`** to purge all images
    - **`/static/css/*`** to purge all CSS files

- You can add up to **10 patterns**, each on a separate line, to target specific content.

## 2. Execute Purge
- After entering your desired patterns, click **Purge** to clear the cached files matching those patterns.
