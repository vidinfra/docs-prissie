    - VP9

### Resolution
    - Recommended resolution: **1920×1080 (HD)** or higher
    - Keep the video’s original aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9 landscape, 9:16 vertical)

## 1. Upload From Local
Click Upload Video to choose a file from your device. After selecting the file, Vidinfra begins the upload and prepares it for **encoding**, **thumbnail generation**, and **playback**. This option is ideal when you are adding new recordings, edited content, or raw files stored on your computer.


## 2. Import From External Platforms
You can fetch videos directly from supported external platforms. Vidinfra pulls the file from the source and adds it to your library without requiring you to download it manually. 

You can import videos directly from supported platforms, including:

- Vimeo
- Bunny
- Zoom
- Vdocipher
- Gumlet
- Wistia
- Amazon S3
- Other connected storage services
