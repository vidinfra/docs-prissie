# Nuxt Integration Guide

To use Tenbyte Image Optimization in Nuxt, you only need to define the base URL for your Tenbyte image service. 

Once configured, Nuxt will route your image requests through Tenbyte and return optimized versions automatically.

```typescript nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  image: {
    tenbyte: {
      baseURL: 'https://demo.tenbyte.io'
    }
  }
})
```

To use Tenbyte as your image provider, you can start with the following configuration snippet:
```vue
<NuxtImg
  provider="tenbyte"
  src="/sea.jpeg"
  width="300"
  height="500"
  fit="cover"
  :modifiers="{ format: 'auto', compress: 'true' }"
/>
```
The component will output a 300×500 optimized image, applying compression and using next gen formats for browsers that support them.
