Create and manage API keys to securely connect applications with Tenbyte. Control key permissions, define access scope, and set validity periods without using primary login credentials.


## Open the API Keys Page

- To get started, open **API Keys** from the Organization menu in the left sidebar. You’ll be taken to a simple dashboard that lists your existing keys.

    </Frame>

- If you haven’t created any keys yet, the page will show an empty state with a **Create API Key** option.

## Create a New API Key
- Click **+ Create API Key** in the top-right corner to open the creation form.

Here’s what you’ll need to fill in:

- **Name** — Give the key a short name so you know what it’s used for.  
- **Expiration** — Choose how long the key should remain valid:
  - 1 Month  
  - 6 Months  
  - 12 Months  
  - Unlimited  
- **Scope Access** — Pick the services or areas this key should be able to access.

--- 

## Generate the Key
- After completing the fields, select **Create** to generate the key.

    </Frame>

- Your new API key will be generated and displayed once.

    </Frame>

## View or Manage Existing Keys
- Any key you’ve already created will appear in the dashboard.  
From here, you can:

    - Check the key’s metadata  
    - Disable a key if you no longer want it active  
    - Delete a key entirely  
    - Create new keys whenever your applications need separate access

This setup helps you keep your API usage organized and gives you a clear way to control which systems can interact with your Tenbyte workspace.
