# Webhooks Overview
See all active and inactive webhooks and manage their configurations with ease.

## Open the Webhook Settings

    <Frame caption="Webhook from Library">
        <img src="/images/vidinfra/library-43.png" alt="Webhook from Library"/>
    </Frame>

- This will open the webhook dashboard for your video library.

- The Webhooks dashboard shows all the webhook integrations you have created. 

    <Frame caption="Webhook Dashboard">

    </Frame>

Each entry provides a quick overview of the endpoint, subscribed events, and the current status of the webhook.

### Name
Displays the name you assigned to the webhook. This helps you identify different integrations at a glance.

### Endpoint
- Shows the URL where Vidinfra sends event notifications.
- Only valid and publicly accessible endpoints will receive webhook requests.

### Events
Lists the video events the webhook is subscribed to, such as `video.created`, `video.upload.started`, `video.upload.completed`, `video.upload.failed`, `video.queued` and more. 

You can see additional events by selecting the **event count indicator**.

### Status
Indicates whether the webhook is **active** or **inactive**. An **Active webhook** is currently receiving event updates.

### Date Modified
Displays the last time the webhook configuration was updated.

### Actions Menu
Use the options menu (**`three dots`**) to **edit** or **delete** a webhook.
