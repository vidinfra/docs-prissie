# SSL Management for Your Distribution

In this section, you can manage SSL certificates to secure your CDN distribution URL, ensuring that all traffic between your users and the CDN is encrypted.

## 1. Choose Your SSL Type
You can select one of the following SSL options:

1. **Tenbyte SSL (Free)**: This option automatically provides an SSL certificate for your distribution. 
2. **Let's Encrypt SSL**: It ensures secure HTTPS traffic, but you will need to complete the setup steps.
3. **Custom SSL**: If you have your own SSL certificate, you can upload it for use with your CDN distribution.

## 2. Additional SSL Settings
Here you can configure other settings related to SSL:

1. **SNI Hostname**: Set the hostname used for the SSL handshake. 
2. **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**: Enable this option to automatically redirect users who access your content via HTTP to the secure HTTPS version. 
3. **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3**: You can enable or disable support for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. These newer versions of HTTP offer improved performance and reduced latency for faster content delivery.
