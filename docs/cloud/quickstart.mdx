This guide walks you through the complete process of creating your **Tenbyte Cloud account** and accessing the dashboard for the first time. 

Once your account is active, you’ll be able to explore the platform, deploy cloud resources, and manage your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A **Tenbyte account** — [Sign up](https://console.tenbytecloud.com/app/).
- A valid email address that you can access immediately. 
- A project or application that you want to deploy.
- A basic understanding of virtual machines, storage, or general cloud concepts.

- Once you have confirmed your email, you will be able to access your **Tenbyte Cloud dashboard**.
- If the email doesn’t appear:
    - Check the spam or promotions folder  
    - Make sure the email address was typed correctly

##  Use Social Sign-Up
- If you prefer a faster setup, you can choose **Sign Up with Google** instead of creating a password.

- This method links your Tenbyte Cloud account to your Google identity, making login simple and password-free.
- Use this option if you want:
    - Quicker onboarding  
    - Fewer passwords to manage  
    - Automatic access control through your Google account  
- Once completed, your dashboard will open just like a regular email-based account.
