The Purge by Pattern option allows you to remove cached content based on specific URL patterns. 

This is useful when you want to clear specific files or resources, such as images or static files, without affecting the entire cache.

## Enter Purge Patterns
- In the input box, enter the URL patterns for the content you want to purge. 

    <Frame caption="Purge by Pattern">
        <img src="/images/cdn/34.png" alt="Origin" />
    </Frame>

- Each pattern must start with **`/`**, and you can use **`*`** as a wildcard to specify multiple files. For example:
    - **`/images/*`** to purge all images
    - **`/static/css/*`** to purge all CSS files

- You can add up to **10 patterns**, each on a separate line, to target specific content.

## Execute Purge
- After entering your desired patterns, click **Purge** to clear the cached files matching those patterns.
