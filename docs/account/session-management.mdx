# Manage Your Active Sessions

From here, you can review active sessions, check IP addresses, and terminate any device you no longer want connected.

## 1. Current Sessions
- This section shows the device you are currently using to access your Tenbyte account.

    </Frame>

For each active session, you will see:
    
    1. Device Type (e.g., Desktop)
    2. IP Address
    3. Activation Time (when the session started)

This helps you confirm that the current login session is valid and expected.

## 2. Other Sessions

The **Other Sessions** section lists all additional devices that are signed in to your account.

    </Frame>

Each entry displays:

    1. Device name
    2. IP address
    2. Last active timestamp
    3. Terminate button

If you see a session you don’t recognize, you can click Terminate to immediately revoke access for that device.

### Ending a Session

To remove a session find the session under **Other Sessions** and click **Terminate**. The device will be logged out instantly.
