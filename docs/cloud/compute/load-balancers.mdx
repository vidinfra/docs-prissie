## 3. Location Selection
- Under Location, select the data center where your resource will be created.

## 4. Public IPv4 Address
- Enable Public IPv4 if you require an external IP address for the load balancer.
<Note>
    Enabling Public IPv4 will add an additional US$2/month charge for the resource.
</Note>

## 5. Select VPC Network
- Choose an existing VPC network for your resource or create a new one to isolate and secure your virtual machines.

## 7. Configure Forwarding Rules
- Set up forwarding rules to define how the load balancer should route traffic to the VMs:
    - **Protocol**: Select TCP.
    - **Port**: Enter the source port.
    - **Target Port**: Set the target port for the VM.
- You can add multiple rules if your application requires different ports or protocols.
