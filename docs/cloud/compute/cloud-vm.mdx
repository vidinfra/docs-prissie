# Virtual Machines in Tenbyte Cloud

This guide walks you through the complete process of creating a virtual machine (VM) in **Tenbyte Cloud**. You’ll learn how to select an OS or app image, configure the machine type, set up networking, and finalize your resource.

## 1. Select Virtual Machine
- To begin, open your Tenbyte Cloud dashboard and choose Virtual Machine from the list of available services.

- This takes you to the VM creation page where all configuration options are listed.

## 2. Choose Operating System
- If you want to install an operating system, select **Operating System** and choose the OS.

You can choose from the following operating systems:

1. **`Ubuntu`**
2. **`Debian`**
3. **`Rocky`**
4. **`CentOS`**
5. **`OpenSUSE`**
6. **`AlmaLinux`**
7. **`Fedora`**
8. **`Windows (BYOL)`**

<Note>
    Each OS image is maintained and updated regularly to provide a reliable foundation for your workloads.
</Note>

## 3. Choose App Catalog
- If you need an application, select **App Catalog**.

Choose from available applications like: 

1. **`cPanel`**
2. **`Docker`**
3. **`Mikrotik`**
4. **`Moodle`**
5. **`Node.js`**
6. **`Cyberpanel`**
7. **`Mailcoach`**
8. **`Plesk`**
9. **`Magento`**
10. **`pfSense`**
11. **`WordPress`**

<Note>
    For both operating systems and applications, you can choose the version that best fits your requirements during the setup process.   
</Note>

## 4. Choose Empty Disk for ISO Booting
- If you plan to install an operating system manually using an ISO image, choose Empty disk. 

## 5. Select your Location
- Choose your Data center where the resource will be created.

<Tip>
    Selecting a region close to your users or infrastructure can improve performance and lower latency.
</Tip>

## 6. Select Server Class
- Choose between **General Purpose** or **Heavy Compute** based on your workload type.

    </Frame>
    1. **General Purpose**: Ideal for everyday applications, low to medium traffic workloads, and business systems.
    2. **Heavy Compute**: Recommended for high-traffic systems, intensive compute tasks, and enterprise workloads.
## 7. Configure your VM Size
- Select the **VM size** based on the resources your application requires.
- You can configure -
    - **CPU Cores** – Match the number of cores to your processing demands.
    - **Memory (RAM)** – Select memory based on your application size and performance needs.
    - **Storage** – Choose the disk size appropriate for your files, databases, or workloads.

- This flexible configuration lets you build a VM that fits your exact use case.
## 8. Public IPv4 Address
- If you require an **external IP** for your VM, **enable Public IPv4**.

<Note>
    Enabling Public IPv4 will incur an additional US$2/month charge.
</Note>

## 9. Select VPC Network
- Choose an existing VPC network or create a new one for private and secure network setup.

    </Frame>
- If you want to set up your own VPC network, you can follow the steps in the [Tenbyte VPC](/docs/cloud/networking/vpc) page found in the **Networking and Security** section.

## 10. Fill in User Information and Billing Details
1. **Username**: Enter a username for your virtual machine. This will be used to log in. 
2. **Password**: Set a password that meets the security criteria
3. **Confirm Password**: Re-type the password to ensure it has been entered correctly.
4. **SSH Public Key**: If you prefer passwordless SSH access, add your SSH key here. Select **SSH Keys**, and a pop-up will appear where you can enter a key name and paste your public key. Use the format:
**`ssh-keytype base64_encoded_key optional_comment`**.

    <Note>
        Only single-line keys are accepted. Make sure the key is not wrapped, contains no extra spaces, and matches one of the supported key types.
    </Note>

5. **Initialization Script**: Optionally, you can add a custom configuration for the VM by using an initialization script. This can include cloud-init configurations to automatically set up your VM during the creation process.
6. **Resource Name**: Provide a resource name for your VM. This will be used to generate a suitable hostname for the machine if applicable.
7. **Estimated Monthly Cost**: This gives you an overview of what you’ll be charged based on the current setup.
8. **Billing Account**: Choose a billing account to associate with the VM. 

<Warning>
    If your account has limitations, a notice will appear, indicating these limits. The restriction will be removed once your total top-up reaches US$2,000.
</Warning>

    
## 11. Create the VM
- Once you’ve completed all fields and reviewed your details, click the Create button to finalize the creation of your virtual machine.
