Manage SSL certificates for your CDN distribution to secure delivery URLs and ensure encrypted traffic between users and the CDN.

## Choose Your SSL Type
You can select one of the following SSL options:

1. **Tenbyte SSL (Free)**: This option automatically provides an SSL certificate for your distribution. 
2. **Let's Encrypt SSL**: It ensures secure HTTPS traffic, but you will need to complete the setup steps.
3. **Custom SSL**: If you have your own SSL certificate, you can upload it for use with your CDN distribution.

## Additional SSL Settings
Here you can configure other settings related to SSL:

1. **SNI Hostname**: Set the hostname used for the SSL handshake. 
2. **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**: Enable this option to automatically redirect users who access your content via HTTP to the secure HTTPS version. 
3. **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3**: You can enable or disable support for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. These newer versions of HTTP offer improved performance and reduced latency for faster content delivery.
