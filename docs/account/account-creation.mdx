# Sign up for a Tenbyte account
This page explains how to create a new Tenbyte account so you can access the dashboard and start working with the available Tenbyte services. The process is straightforward, and you only need a few details to complete it.

## What you need

Before you start, make sure you have access to the following:
- An email address that can receive messages
- A password you want to use
- The verification code sent to your inbox

Completing these steps is enough to open the dashboard for the first time.

## 1. Sign up for a account
- To sign up for Tenbyte services, go to the Tenbyte website and select **Get Started** on the Tenbyte [**home page**](https://beta.tenbyte.io/)

## 2. Use Social Sign-Up
If you prefer a faster setup, you can sign up using:

    1. Google
    2. GitHub

This lets you access Tenbyte without creating a separate password.


Once you’re signed in, you can take a moment to review your profile details, set your organization information, and check your active sessions. You’ll also be able to access the main services like Cloud, CDN, Object Storage, and Vidinfra whenever you’re ready.
