# Tenbyte Virtual Private Network (VPC)
This guide shows you how to create and manage **Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)** in **Tenbyte Cloud**.

## 1. Select VPC Network
- From your dashboard, click on **VPC Network** to create your own VPC network.

- When you first access the Network section, the default network is named **My Network**

    </Frame>

## 2. Create a New VPC Network
- To create a new VPC network, click on **Create new** in the Network section.

    </Frame>

- Choose **VPC network** as the **Type**. This allows you to create a private network to group and isolate your cloud resources.
- Select the data center where the network will be created.
- Enter a name for your new VPC.
- Click **Create** to create the new VPC network.

<Note>
    The VPC network is free of charge, but you will be charged for resources connected to it.
</Note>

## 3. Assign VPC Network During VM Creation
- While creating a **new VM**, you can assign the newly created VPC network. To learn how to **create a virtual machine**, check out the [Virtual Machine](/docs/cloud/compute/cloud-vm) page under the **Compute** section of this document. 
- In the VM creation screen, under VPC network, select the desired network from the dropdown:
    - My Network (default)
    - Newly Created

    </Frame>
This ensures your VM is connected to the correct network during creation.

## 4. Edit VM Network Settings
- If you want to change the VPC network after creating the VM, navigate to the **Network Section** in the VM settings.

    </Frame>

- Click **Add sub-interface** to create additional interfaces or to modify the current one.

    <Frame caption="Add your VPC">

    </Frame>

- Enter the **VLAN ID** for the sub-interface.
- Select the VPC network you want to associate with the VM.

    </Frame>
- Click **Add** to associate the **VPC** network with your **VM**.

    </Frame>

## 5. Review VPC Network and Resources

After creating or modifying your VPC, you can view the VMs associated with the network. The **My Network** or **new vpc** will list the VMs connected to it, showing the public and private IP addresses.
