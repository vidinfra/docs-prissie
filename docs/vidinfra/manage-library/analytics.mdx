This dashboard displays how videos are delivered across the network, highlighting usage trends, delivery performance, and caching efficiency over a selected time range.

- When you enter your preferred video library, you will see a **Statistics** option in the left sidebar. Select it to open the analytics dashboard for that library and view traffic, requests, and caching performance.
