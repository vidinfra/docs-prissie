This guide explains how to upload, process, and stream your first video with Vidinfra, Tenbyte’s all in one video platform.

## Prerequisites

- A **video file** ready to upload (e.g. `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mkv`)
- An **API key** with `assets:write` permission

## Stream your Video

- Once your video is uploaded, Vidinfra automatically begins processing it. This includes:

    - Optimizing the video for playback efficiency.
    - Transcoding the video into multiple renditions and adaptive bitrates for different network speeds and devices.
    - Converting the video into `HLS` (HTTP Live Streaming) and `DASH` (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) formats for smooth, adaptive playback.

- After processing, your video is ready to be streamed. You can now:
