# Manage your organization settings

Welcome to the [Tenbyte Organization settings](https://beta.tenbyte.io/) page.
This section helps you manage how your workspace operates — including team members, permissions, API keys, and general organization preferences.

From the left-side menu, you can explore all pages that define your organization-level controls:

1. [Members](/docs/organization/members): Add team members, send invitations, and assign permissions for CDN distributions and workspace resources.
2. [API Keys](/docs/organization/api-keys): Create and manage API credentials used to authenticate with Tenbyte services.
3. [General Settings](/docs/organization/general-settings): Review and update your organization name, branding, and default preferences.
