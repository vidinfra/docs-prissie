# Web Player SDK

The Vidinfra Player SDK is a lightweight, type-safe JavaScript library designed to control video players inside iframes. It leverages the power of the postMessage API for secure, real-time communication between the parent page and embedded video players. Whether you're integrating a video player into your app or building custom controls, the Player SDK makes it easy and efficient.

This documentation provides an overview of the library’s features, installation, usage instructions, and examples to help you get started quickly.

## Key Features

- **Unified API**: One class manages both controlling existing iframes and embedding new players.
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions for a reliable development - experience.
- **Framework-agnostic**: Works seamlessly with any JavaScript framework or plain JavaScript.
- **Secure**: Built-in origin validation for postMessage communication to ensure safe interactions.
- **Event-driven**: Listen to real-time player events such as play, pause, and time updates.
- **Lightweight**: The SDK is approximately 15KB when minified, making it efficient and easy to use.

## Installation
### NPM Installation

To install the Vidinfra Player SDK via npm, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @vidinfra/player
```

### CDN Installation

Alternatively, you can load the SDK via a CDN:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@vidinfra/player/dist/player.global.js"></script>
```
This method allows you to use the SDK without needing to install it locally, making it easy to integrate into static or non-Node.js projects.

## Quick Start

The Player SDK allows you to control existing iframe players and create embedded players on the fly. Below are the basic instructions for both use cases.

### Control an Existing Iframe

If you already have an iframe on your page and want to control the video player inside it, you can easily use the **`Player`** class. With just a few lines of code, you can target an existing iframe, wait for it to be ready, and start playing the video.

```JavaScript
import { Player } from "@vidinfra/player";

const player = new Player("iframe");

player.on("play", () => {
  console.log("Video started playing");
});

await player.whenReady();
await player.play();
```
### Creating an Embedded Player

If you want to embed a video player directly into your page, Vidinfra can automatically create and inject an iframe for you. You can configure the player with your desired settings like autoplay, volume, and aspect ratio.

```JavaScript
import { Player } from "@vidinfra/player";

const player = new Player("vidinfra-player", {
  libraryId: default,
  videoId: default,
  playerId: default,
  autoplay: false,
  loop: false,
  muted: false,
  controls: true,
  preload: true,
  aspectRatio: "16:9"
});

player.setVolume(0.5);
```
<Note>
    To learn how to copy a video ID, check the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/vidinfra/quickstart#copy-your-video-id) in the Vidinfra section.
</Note>

## Usage

### Controlling an Existing Iframe
If you already have an iframe in your HTML, you can control it by passing the iframe element or a CSS selector.

#### Javascript 
```Javascript
import { Player } from "@vidinfra/player";

const player = new Player("#player-iframe");

await player.whenReady();
await player.play();
```

#### CDN
```html
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe
  id="vidinfra-iframe-player"
    src="https://player.vidinfra.com/{librayID}/default/{videoID}?autoplay=false&loop=false&muted=false&controls=true&preload=true"
    loading="lazy"
    style="border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;"
    allow="accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;"
    allowfullscreen="true">
  </iframe>
</div>
```
### Creating an Embedded Player
You can dynamically create an embedded player by specifying a target element for the player:

#### Javascript
```Javascript
import { Player } from "@vidinfra/player";

const player = new Player("vidinfra-player", {
  libraryId: default,
  videoId: default,
  playerId: default,
  autoplay: false,
  loop: false,
  muted: false,
  controls: true,
  preload: true,
  aspectRatio: "16:9"
});
```
#### CDN
```html
<div id="vidinfra-player"></div>

<script src="https://unpkg.com/@vidinfra/player/dist/player.global.js"></script>
<script>
  const player = new Vidinfra.Player("vidinfra-player", {
    libraryId: default,
    videoId: default,
    playerId: default,
    autoplay: false,
    loop: false,
    muted: false,
    controls: true,
    preload: true,
    aspectRatio: "16:9"
  });
</script>
```
## API Reference

### Constructor
```Javascript
new Player(element: HTMLIFrameElement | HTMLElement | string)
new Player(element: HTMLElement | string, options: PlayerOptions)
```

#### Parameters
- **`element`** - An iframe element, CSS selector for an iframe, or a container element for embedding
- **`options`** - Configuration options for creating an embedded player (required when creating an embed)

### PlayerOptions
The PlayerOptions defines all the customizable settings for configuring a Vidinfra player. Here, you specify key details about the video and player behavior. You can set the video’s library ID, video ID, and the player’s size, playback options, and more.

```Javascript
interface PlayerOptions {
  // Vidinfra player (required)
  libraryId: string | number;
  videoId: string | number;
  playerId?: string | number; // Optional, defaults to 'default'

  // Display options
  width?: number | string;
  height?: number | string;
  aspectRatio?: string; // e.g., "16:9", "4:3"

  // Playback options
  autoplay?: boolean;
  loop?: boolean;
  muted?: boolean;
  controls?: boolean;
  preload?: boolean;

  // Advanced options
  loading?: "lazy" | "eager";
  allow?: string;
  className?: string;
  baseUrl?: string;
}
```

## Examples
### Basic Playback Control
```Javascript
import { Player } from "@vidinfra/player";

const player = new Player("#player-iframe");

await player.whenReady();

document.getElementById("play-btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  player.play();
});

document.getElementById("pause-btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  player.pause();
});

player.on("timeupdate", (state) => {
  const currentTime = Math.floor(state.currentTime);
  const duration = Math.floor(state.duration);
  console.log(`${currentTime}s / ${duration}s`);
});
```
### Volume Control
```Javascript
import { Player } from "@vidinfra/player";

const player = new Player("#player-iframe");

await player.whenReady();

const volumeSlider = document.getElementById("volume");
volumeSlider.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  const volume = e.target.value / 100;
  player.setVolume(volume);
});

const muteBtn = document.getElementById("mute");
muteBtn.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const isMuted = await player.getMuted();
  player.setMuted(!isMuted);
});
```

### Creating and Controlling an Embed
```Javascript
import { Player } from "@vidinfra/player";

const player = new Player("vidinfra-player", {
  libraryId: default,
  videoId: default,
  playerId: default,
  autoplay: false,
  loop: false,
  muted: false,
  controls: true,
  preload: true,
  aspectRatio: "16:9"
});

player.on("ready", () => {
  console.log("Player created and ready");
});

player.on("play", () => {
  console.log("Video playing");
});

setTimeout(() => {
  player.update({ loop: true });
}, 5000);
```
### TypeScript Example

```Javascript
import { Player, PlayerOptions, WatermarkConfig } from "@vidinfra/player";

const options: PlayerOptions = {
  libraryId: default,
  videoId: default,
  playerId: default,
  autoplay: false,
  loop: false,
  muted: false,
  controls: true,
  preload: true,
  aspectRatio: "16:9"
};

const player = new Player("vidinfra-player", options);

await player.whenReady();

const volume: number = await player.getVolume();
const duration: number = await player.getDuration();

const watermark: WatermarkConfig = {
  text: "Confidential",
  color: "#ffffff",
  opacity: 0.3,
  fontSize: 24
};

await player.addWatermark(watermark);
```
### Security
The Player automatically validates the origin of postMessage communications based on the iframe's source URL. For iframe-side implementations, you should also validate the origin of incoming messages:
```Javascript
window.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  const allowedOrigin = "https://trusted-parent.com";
  if (event.origin !== allowedOrigin) return;
  
  // Handle message
});
```
## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Requires **`postMessage`** API
- Fullscreen API support varies by browser
## TypeScript
Full TypeScript definitions are included with the package:
```Javascript
import { Player, PlayerOptions, WatermarkConfig, WatermarkOptions } from "@vidinfra/player";
```
