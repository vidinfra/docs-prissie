Restrict video playback to approved websites by allowing or blocking specific referrer domains and preventing unauthorized embeds.

To open Security Settings, see Open Security Settings in the [Country Access Policy](/docs/vidinfra/security/signed-urls#1-open-security-settings) section.

## Allow by Default
All websites can access your video unless you add blocked domains.

    <Frame caption="Allow by Default">
        <img src="/images/vidinfra/library-41.png" alt="Allow by Default" />
    </Frame>

--- 

## Deny by Default
All websites are blocked unless you add allowed domains.

    <Frame caption="Deny by Default">
        <img src="/images/vidinfra/library-42.png" alt="Deny by Default" />
    </Frame>

--- 

## Domain Restrictions
Add the domains that should be allowed or blocked based on your chosen rule. Use the same list field for either mode.

**Examples**
- `example.com`
- `app.example.com`

<Danger>Only the specified domains will be permitted according to your policy settings.</Danger>

--- 

## Verify access
- Test playback on an allowed domain (should succeed).
- Test playback on a non-allowed domain (should be blocked based on your default rule).
