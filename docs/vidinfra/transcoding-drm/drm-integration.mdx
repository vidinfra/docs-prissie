Apply DRM controls to protect video content and ensure only authorized viewers can stream or access secured media assets.

## Basic DRM

**Basic DRM** keeps your video files safe from direct downloads. When enabled, viewers cannot save or extract the source video file from the player.

This is ideal for general content protection where you want to stop casual downloading or copying.

## Multi-DRM Protection

**Multi-DRM** adds a stronger layer of security. It protects your videos from illegal access and screen recording on supported platforms.

This option is designed for premium or sensitive content where strict control over playback is required.
