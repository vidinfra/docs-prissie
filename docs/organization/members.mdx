# Manage Organization Members

This section helps you keep track of everyone who has access to your workspace. You can view your current members, invite new people, and adjust what each person is allowed to do. 

Everything related to team access is grouped here so you can manage it without moving around different parts of the dashboard.

## 1. Members
- This page lists all users in your organization along with their roles and connection details.

    </Frame>
From this dashboard you can view -

   1. **Name** — The member’s full name
   2. **Email** — Email address used to sign in
   3. **Connected With** — Sign-in provider like email, Google, or GitHub
   4. **Role** — Owner, Admin, Member, or custom-defined role
   5. **Joined At** — The date and time the member joined your workspace


To manage a member, open the three-dot menu beside their name.

    <Frame caption="Actions">
        <img src="/images/account/13.png" alt="Actions" />
    </Frame>

The menu gives you a few options:

    1. **Manage Permission** — Adjust what this person can access and control 
    2. **Remove Member** — Remove the user from your organization  
<Danger>
    Removing a member immediately revokes access to all dashboards, APIs, and distributions.
</Danger>

## 2. Invite Member
- To bring new people into your workspace, select **Add Members**.

    </Frame>

Here’s how the invitation works:

    1. **Enter Email Address** - In the Invite Member section, type the email of the person you want to invite.
    2. **Send Invitation** - Once the email is entered click on **Send invitation**, an invitation will be sent.

    <Frame caption="Send Invitation to your Team Member">
        <img src="/images/account/15.png" alt="Send Invitation" />
    </Frame>

<Warning>
    The person you invite must accept the email invitation before they appear in your Members list.
</Warning>

Once they join, you can assign permissions to decide what they can access.

## 3. Permissions
- Permissions define what a member can view, edit, or delete inside your organization. Permissions are grouped into two areas:

    1. CDN Distribution
    2. Organization

You can switch between these tabs to assign access rights.

### CDN Distribution Permissions
- If your organization has CDN distributions, they will appear in this area. 

Each distribution can have its own access settings.

    </Frame>

If you want to create a new distribution, check the guide at [Create CDN Distribution](docs/cdn/distributions/create-distribution).

### Organization Permissions

- These permissions control access to global settings within your workspace. 

    <Frame caption="Organization Permissions">
        <img src="/images/account/17.png" alt="Organization Permissions" />
    </Frame>

You can assign access for:

1. **Members** — Invite users and manage their permissions  
2. **Billing** — View invoices and payment information  
3. **API** — Create and manage API keys  

    For each area, you can choose:

        - **`can view`**
        - **`can edit`**
        - **`can edit`** (no delete)
        - **`no access`**

This lets you set up access in a way that fits your team and how you want to share responsibilities.
