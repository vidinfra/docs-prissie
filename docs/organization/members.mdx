# Manage Organization Members

From here, you can view existing members, invite new users, assign permissions, and control who can access different parts of your Tenbyte organization.

## 1. Members
- This page lists all users in your organization along with their roles and connection details.

From this dashboard you can view -

   1. **Name** — The member’s full name
   2. **Email** — Email address used to sign in
   3. **Connected With** — Sign-in provider like email, Google, or GitHub
   4. **Role** — Owner, Admin, Member, or custom-defined role
   5. **Joined At** — The date and time the member joined your workspace


Click the **three-dot menu** beside any member to access.

    1. **Manage Permission** — Edit what this member can view or manage
    2. **Remove Member** — Permanently remove the user from your organization
<Danger>
    Removing a member immediately revokes access to all dashboards, APIs, and distributions.

    2. **Send Invitation** - Once the email is entered click on **Send invitation**, an invitation will be sent.

<Warning>
    The invited user must accept the invitation to join your organization.
</Warning>

- After accepting the invite, the member appears in your Members list. You can also assign permissions to control what they can access

## 3. Permissions
- Permissions define what a member can view, edit, or delete inside your organization. Permissions are grouped into two areas:

    1. CDN Distribution
    2. Organization

You can switch between these tabs to assign access rights.

### CDN Distribution Permissions
- When your organization has one or more CDN distributions, they appear here.

    </Frame>
To learn how to create a CDN distribution, visit the [Create CDN Distribution](docs/cdn/distributions/create-distribution) page in the CDN section.

### Organization Permissions

- These permissions control access to global settings within your workspace.

    </Frame>

Available permission areas are -

    1. **Members** — Manage users and permissions
    2. **Billing** — Access billing details, invoices, and payment methods
    3. **API** — Manage and generate API keys

    For each area, you can choose:

        - **`can view`**
        - **`can edit`**
        - **`can edit`** (no delete)
        - **`no access`**

This gives you full control over what each member can do inside your organization.
