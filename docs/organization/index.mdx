# Manage your organization settings

The Organization section brings together the parts of your workspace that relate to team access and shared settings. It’s where you manage who can join, decide their level of access, and keep the basic details of your organization up to date.

The menu includes a few areas you’ll use when setting things up:

1. [Organization Members](/docs/organization/members): Add team members, send invitations, and assign permissions for CDN distributions and workspace resources.
2. [API Keys](/docs/organization/api-keys): Create and manage API credentials used to authenticate with Tenbyte services.
3. [General Settings](/docs/organization/general-settings): Review and update your organization name, branding, and default preferences.
