# Configure your Access Rules

The Access Rules section lets you manage how users and systems access your CDN content.
## 1. General Info
The General Info section allows you to define the rule name, type, and matching pattern for your access rule.

    </Frame>

- **Rule Name**: Give your rule a unique name. 
- **Rule Type**: Choose the rule type that best fits your use case. You can select Prefix or Domain:

    1. **Prefix**: The rule applies to URLs that begin with a specific string.
    2. **Regex**: The rule applies to a specific pattern or regular expression that matches domain or path names.
- **Match Pattern**: Define how the rule should match the URL or domain. 

    <Note>
        Spaces are not allowed, the pattern cannot start with `*`, and it must start with `/`.
    </Note>

## 2. Rule Configurations
This section lets you define the main access rules. You can configure settings for country access, IP access, referrer access, and token authentication.

### Country Access Policy
- Controls access based on the **user's country**.

    </Frame>

- You can either **allow access** by default for all countries or **deny access** by default and then specify exceptions.
- If you deny access by default, you can choose specific countries to allow access.


### IP Access Policy
- Allows you to control access based on **IP addresses**.

    </Frame>

- Allow access by default means anyone can access the content, and you only specify exceptions.
- Deny access by default means access is blocked unless you specify which IP addresses or ranges are allowed.
- You can use CIDR notation to define allowed or denied IP ranges.

### Referrer Access Policy
- Controls access based on the **referring domain**.

    <Frame caption="Referrer Access Policy">
        <img src="/images/cdn/27.png" alt="Referrer Access Policy" />
    </Frame>

- You can either allow access by default for all referrers or deny access by default and only allow specific referrers.
- To specify which referrers are allowed, you can add the domains under the Specify Domain(s) option.

### Token Authentication
- Secures access by requiring a secret token for every request made to your CDN.

    <Frame caption="Token Authentication">
        <img src="/images/cdn/28.png" alt="Token Authentication" />
    </Frame>

- **Enable Token Authentication** by turning the toggle on and setting a **Secret Token**.
- This token will need to be included in the URL or request header when accessing content, ensuring that only authorized users with the token can access your resources.
- You can generate a new token using the **Generate Token** button, and then copy it for use in your requests.
